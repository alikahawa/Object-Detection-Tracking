# Object-Detection-Tracking
This repo contains two simple projects, one for object tracking using OpenCV and the other one is for object tracking using Amazon sagemaker (In this object detection project, what we're doing is we are going to train an object detector using an in built sagemaker algorithm which will detect faces of cats and dogs)
